# Hi there!

My name is Liron David-Shiloah and this is my React project.<br>
It was written as part of a full stack course,
In this file I have added guidance and notes that will make it easier for you to explore the application.
## Lets start-

**The site is responsive and suitable for viewing on a computer screen, tablet or phone.**<br>
In order to run this project on vsc, you will need to run those terminal commands-

```
npm install
```
```
npm start
```
```
json-server --watch db.json --port 8000
```
**The port to be selected when running the server is -8000.**

Follow the numbers in the image 


![Initial screen-Before sign in](<public/images/Home-not signInYet.png>)

On the initial screen of the site you can see all the tickets on the site.
In the menus above you can do-
1. Registration
2. Login
3. Company logo. Clicking on it will lead to the home screen. (the current screen).
4. About the company.
5. Search bar, currently inactive.
6. An "i" button that will appear on every card and will refer to complete information about the business.

## Register screen-
![Register screen](public/images/register.png)

The registration screen contains a lot of information about the customer and except for "state", all the information is required.
Pay attention to error messages if they appear because they will guide you on how to enter the information.
At the end of the form, you have the option of being a business customer or a regular customer,
The difference between the two will be shown in the following screens.
Please sign in as a business user so you can see all the available options.

If the registration was successful, you will see a message in the corner of the screen confirming this. 
**There is no need to "login" if you have just finished registering for the site**


First screen after sign-in (business User)
![Business user first screen](public/images/businessUser.png)

2. As the button says- "logout"
3. "My cards"- will show the cards that the current user created on the site (for business users only).
4. A heart icon - clicking on it will copy the card to the user's favorites list.
5. My favorites - a screen that will contain the cards that the customer transferred to his list of favorites.
