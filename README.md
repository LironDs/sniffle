# Hi there!

My name is Liron David-Shiloah and this is my React+Node.js project.<br>
It was written as part of a full stack course,
In this file I have added guidance and notes that will make it easier for you to explore the application.
## Lets start-

**The site is responsive and suitable for viewing on a computer screen, tablet or phone.**<br>
In order to run this project on VSC , you will need to run those terminal commands-

```
npm install
```
## On sniffle-client
```
npm start
```
## On sniffle-server

```
nodemon
```

**In order for the server to connect to MongoDB Atlas, please insert the .env file you received separately.**


#### The table below gives you 3 types of users with different permissions,<br> you are welcome to try them all. <br> Each user will give you different permission and different menus.

## Register screen-

The registration screen contains a lot of information about the customer and except for "state", all the information is required.
Pay attention to error messages if they appear because they will guide you on how to enter the information.
At the end of the form, you have the option of being a business customer or a regular customer,
The difference between the two will be shown in the following screens.
Please sign in as a business user so you can see all the available options.

If the registration was successful, you will see a message in the corner of the screen confirming this.
